👋 Hi, I’m @MarcelPerm

👀 I’m interested in data analysis and visualization.

🌱 I’m currently learning Python with libraries such as numpy, pandas, math, and matplotlib (working through VsCode and Jupyter).

💻 Languages:

Python: Proficient with libraries like numpy, pandas, math, matplotlib.
SQL: Experienced in writing various queries including nested, join, and window functions (PostgreSQL, Redash).
M: Familiarity gained through work in POWER BI.
🛠 Tools:

MS Excel / Google Sheets / POWER QUERY: Advanced skills in data preprocessing, cleaning, pivot tables, VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, etc. (can brush up on VBA if needed).
POWER BI: Building visualizations and database models.
Strong understanding of product metrics.
Highly trainable, receptive to feedback and guidance, eager to grow and improve.
🌍 I'm passionate about learning languages: English (B-2) and Spanish (A-2). I am proactive and constantly generating various hypotheses. I enjoy working with numbers and drawing insights from data, supported by compelling visualizations.

⚡ Fun fact: I've navigated through different realms of analysis - from being an analyst at a factory to the city ministry. Bureaucracy 🤢🤮
